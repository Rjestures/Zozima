    <string name="aboutss"><b><font color="#000000">About Us</font></b>\nZoZima is an Indian-origin social commerce platform founded by Abdul Mazid and Shadab Rais in January 2018. It enables small businesses and individuals to start their online stores via social channels such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram etc. ZoZima is headquartered in Lucknow.\n\n<b><font color="#000000">Overview</font></b>\nZoZima has become one of the fastest-growing e-commerce companies in India.  Our Story It was an incidental meeting with a few small business owners who had discovered the power of social platforms in starting and scaling their business that led to the inception of ZoZima. The founders quickly realized that this is how small businesses will work in the future and built a product to democratize social commerce and enable literally anyone to start this. Our Journey: ZoZima - short for “Leading Reselling Platform” - was preceded by FashNear, a hyperlocal fashion discovery. Website <a href="http://www.zozima.in"> <font color="#0000FF">http://www.zozima.in</font></a> \n\n\</string>
    <string name="terms"><b><font color="#000000">Terms and Condition</font></b>\nZoZima is an application which provides an online marketplace (“Application”) where registered suppliers (“Suppliers”) can offer to sell their respective products to registered users of the Application (“Resellers”). The Company’s role is limited to the managing Application and associated marketing, payment collections, order management, enquiry management and other incidental services to enable the transactions between the Suppliers and the Reseller (“Business”). The Application is not made available on a browser environment and will have to be installed as a standalone mobile application.
        By installing, downloading or even merely visiting or accessing any part of the Application or utilising the Services and accessing the Website, users, including without limitation users who are browsers, Suppliers, Resellers, merchants, or contributors of content (collectively, “User”) agree to be bound by the Terms of Use (“Terms”) contained herein and by other policies of the Company (“Policies”) as posted on the Application or Website from time to time. References to the User in these Terms must be construed in the context in which the term is used. For instance, in these Terms, a User placing an order should be read as the Reseller placing an order.\n\n\The Terms and  the Policies take effect on the date on which the Application is downloaded/Website is used and/or the date on which they are updated, creating a legally binding arrangement between the User and the Company. Users can review the most current version of the Terms and Policies at any time on this page. The Company reserves the right to unilaterally update, change or replace any part of these Terms by posting updates or changes to the Application. It is the responsibility of the Users to check this page periodically for changes. The Users continued use of or access to the Application following the posting of any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes. As long as the User complies with these Terms, the Company grants the User a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited privilege to enter and use our Platforms and services.\n\n\<b><font color="#000000">USER ELIGIBILITY</font></b>\n\User(s) represent and warrant that they have the right to access or use the Platform. Persons who are “incompetent to contract” within the meaning of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 including minors, un-discharged insolvents etc. are not eligible to access and use the Platform.
        The Users understand that any order that they place shall be subject to the terms and conditions set out in these Terms, and any terms and conditions imposed by the Suppliers concerned.
       All commercial/contractual terms are offered by and agreed to between Suppliers and the Users alone. The commercial/contractual terms include without limitation, price, shipping costs, payment methods, payment terms, date, period and mode of delivery, warranties related to products, etc. The Company does not have any control or does not determine or advise or in any way involve itself in the offering or acceptance of such commercial/contractual terms between the Suppliers and the Users. All discounts and offers are by the Suppliers and not by the Company.
      The Users acknowledge and agree that the Company may, at the request of the Supplier, act as the payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from them on behalf of the Supplier. Upon payment of the amounts to the Company, which are due to the Supplier, the payment obligation to the Supplier for such amounts is completed, and the Company will be responsible for remitting such amounts, to the seller. The Users understand, accept and agree that the payment facility provided by the Company is neither a banking nor financial service but is merely a facilitator providing a third party payment processor for the transactions on the Application. Further, by providing a payment facility, the Company is neither acting as a trustee nor acting in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the transaction or the transaction price. The Company will not be liable for any charges made by the Users bank in relation to the payment of the total amount.
